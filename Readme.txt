This repository contains machine learning projects that I have implemented as part of an online Post Graduate Program in Machine Learning (PGP-DSBA) course offered by Great Learning during Oct 2021 to Nov 2022.

The repository folders are organized according to the machine learning module name and each folder consists of a problem statement document, a jupyter notebook and the dataset.

The ML modules covered are:

Applied Statistics (or Statistical Learning)
Data Mining
Predicitive Modeling
Machine Learning
Statistical Modeling
Unsupervised learning
Capstone project
Feel free to ask any queries regarding the projects through email (email-id: vinitsharmaa1205@gmail.com).
