****Data Science Project Repository****

This repository contains machine learning projects that I have implemented as part of an online Post Graduate Program in Machine Learning (PGP-DSBA) course offered by Great Learning during Oct 2021 to Nov 2022.

The repository folders are organized according to the machine learning module name and each folder consists of a problem statement document, a jupyter notebook and the dataset.

The ML modules covered are:

1. Applied Statistics (or Statistical Learning)
2. Data Mining
3. Predictive Modeling
4. Machine Learning
5. Statistical Modeling
6. Unsupervised learning
7. Capstone project

Feel free to ask any queries regarding the projects through email (email-id: vinitsharmaa1205@gmail.com).
